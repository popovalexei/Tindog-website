# Tindog - website-app.

Tindog is a mockup website/app that I developed for practice and CV purposes. It is designed for dog owners to find new and interesting dogs around them, based on the popular dating app, Tinder.

Technologies Used:

The website was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and the Grid System.

Site Features:

The site is responsive on laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It features a clean and modern design with bright colors, images of dogs, and playful animations. Users can navigate through the site to learn more about Tindog and its features, view pictures of dogs, pricing plans and sign up for the service. 

Access the Site:

You can access Tindog online at https://popovalexei.github.io/Tindog-website/. Check it out and let me know what you think!

Tindog is a great example of my skills in web development and showcases my ability to create a fully functional and visually appealing website using modern technologies.
